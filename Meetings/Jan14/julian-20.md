# Julian meeting, Mon Jan 20

OWL-S: event ontology developed with this?
> No, seems to concern services and how they process data

Terry Payne: contact him, he might be doing event ontologies.
> A brief look through his papers reveals nothing, but contacting him and closer scrutiny might be worthwhile

Valantina Tamma, too -> married.
(In Cicara's group, CMU. Now at Liverpool)
> same as above

Framework Programme 7 FP7 

Ontoweb.

Open knowledge institute. John Domingue & Emilio?
At the Open University.
> Story Making project, very useful: http://projects.kmi.open.ac.uk/storymaking

Innsbruck group does this.
DERI Digital Enterprise Research Instite
> www.sti-innsbruck.at and see.sti-innsbruck.at. Mentions stuff with e-commerce, but a casual look through doesn't reveal any specific projects in this area.

Has someone come up with metrics for ontologies? Graph theory?
> Yes, Alani at Southampton. Check the papers.

Create a multi-layer ontology. Julian will send you Ranatunga's dissertation.
> Papers cited: 
> Cavazza and Palmer (2000) presents motivations for a middle layer.
> Chang et al (2005) implement a cognitive middle layer between the minds of agents and the environment.
> van Oijen et al (2012) include domain ontologies in a middle layer between agent systems and virtual worlds.

Is there an upper event ontology?
> Potentially two top levels: events and story

The middle layer could be museums/shopping malls. Bottom layer -> specific shop/museum.

Pathfinding through concepts (generically) so then could be museum, shopping mall, etc. The right collection of appropriately composable ontologies.

Example problems: Degree in Maths/Regulations for completing a CS degree at Bath.

Is a solution feasible? What is possible? What isn't?
