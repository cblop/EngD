Feasibility study looks at what is currently in the space, evaluates all the options.

GPS & compass, accelerometer

Ultrasound or infrared pulses

## My tasks
Look into the ultrasound paper (in the proximity folder)
> No mention of distance detection. Only alerts if an exhibit is 'close'

Look into infrared/ultraviolet/encoding in normal light
Image recognition (SIFT, etc)
Email about getting an iPhone!
