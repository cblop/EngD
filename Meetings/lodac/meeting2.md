# LODAC meeting 2

Show/explain:
- simple web service
- constructing SPARQL queries with Clojure
- narratology paper

Ask about:
- making a recommender service
- narrative ontology for LODAC (perhaps using the DESCRIPTION field for creators)
- presentation in Japanese

So, potential projects might be:
- recommendation system for people new to Japanese art
- the above in the form of a game (pulling images from google image search)
- a 'virtual gallery' creation system
- a narrative system of some kind

Outcomes:
- Getty ULAN: useful database containing artist info, not open or SPARQL, though
- For now, make a web service that browses the LODAC data in a more intuitive way that is more accessible to laypeople.
- W3C is making a provenance model, look at this
