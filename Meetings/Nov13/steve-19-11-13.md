# ESWC paper plan

Focus on making a recommender system that recommends artists based on their distances when clustered.

Clustering should have a basis in information theory, having distances based on probability that artists would share a certain category/facet.

In the system, a user should type a name of an artist or category, then the system suggests related artists based on their cluster distance. The system should also show WHY these artists were recommended (what they have in common).
