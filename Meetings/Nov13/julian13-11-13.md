Web science - there's a conference, Southampton are pioneering it
Look at what people are doing at Ston. What kinds of questions are they asking?
Has more 

Norm recognition. Cultural modelling (maybe irrelevant).

Static curated data, dynamic data that tels you what happened. How people interact with an artifact.

Museums are interested in what people look at - how can we measure this?

Process mining, looking at activity logs, trying to infer process carried out from logged discrete actions - what was the goal?
Van der Aalst - OPM (Open Process Mining). 

Desire lines - the paths that occur naturally, rather than the ones that are laid down by planning. Footsteps in snow show a natural path.

In a museum exhibit, could misdirect the path - treat it like a game.
This would all be using dynamic data - where did people go, how long did they stay there? Could help with clustering works/Creating paths between popular works to help people discover stuff they wouldn't otherwise consider.
Could use it to determint the arrangement of works of art.
You can also express qualitative constraints (constraints of layout, etc). 

Non-linear paths through a museum - the 'surprise me' tour, the 'show me everything' tour, etc.

11-12 two weeks Monday 25.
