# Media meeting: Mon Feb 5

Looking into museums for collaboration. Roman Baths.

Story can be affected by artefacts that a visitor has seen - the story can refer back to it. Or even say: when you were over there, did you notice this other thing?

## My tasks
Look into image recognition algorithms (SIFT). Make a little report.

> Says that FAST/FAST Pyramid would be best
> FAST is the best detector for mobile, but performance is still only ~10fps
> ORB and maybe STAR are also worth considering

It would be good for me to write a summary on what I know about narratology so far.
