# Julian meeting, Mon March 24

Ask Steve what technical limitation of OWL-DL for modelling events is. Look at other Fornara papers to see if it answers this question.

Vincent's paper: can we link my ontology? This would be useful.

Look at Emad's dissertation. 

Agent frameworks: JadeX: BDI on top of JADE, Jason: recommended, responsive devs, also BDI, students at Bath use it.

Means-end reasoning: look it up. Practical reasoning agents. Brachman, Ron. 1998 "Reasoning with intentions". How agents act on obligations.

Remind Julian to send paper on agents & prorities. Explains a bit of JASON.

Could be distributed with multiple people having agents on phones.

Schedule time with Jeehang when you come in for the talk to get stuff working.
