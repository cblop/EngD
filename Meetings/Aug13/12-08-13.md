# Meeting - 12/08

- Link Lodac to Japanese DBPedia
- DBPedia JP has a way of linking artists from links in the content: see if you can use this to create better links
- Contact former student to get their linking code?
- Make the visualisation interactive by adding ability to select connections
- Can you have hierarchies of categories? I.e country -> school -> medium, etc
- Maybe create your own ontology of better-linked data?
