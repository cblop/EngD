## Punch and Judy
We want some kind of description of the world, that all agents understand. For example, if Punch wants to kill Judy, a subgoal would be to move next to her. To do this, he would have to know that StageRight is next to StageRightCentre, etc. Do we add these percepts to all agents when the show is started? Or in this case, do we just want Punch to get within a certain distance of Judy?
