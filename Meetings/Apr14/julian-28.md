# Julian meeting, Mon Apr 28

Talk to Tom Smith about FGD proceedings

- Siggraph

- Procedural, so have it change according to initial moods/emotions
- Need more than just angry and mood. How hard does punch hit judy?
- Desire to hit is achieved by the closeTo subgoal
- Direct in terms of goals: what actions are open to them in order to achieve those goals?
- communication of semantic data: agents send URIs, maybe use Julian's BSF.


- next step: get this working using semantic communication
- build an ontology from what I have, generate RDF
- then use Vincent's RDF monitoring tool
- emotional model is next
- give agents goals, maybe make a GUI to give agents goals and initial state
- Vincent uses AllegroGraph, maybe look at that? Replay takes stuff out of the triple store.
- phone as truncheon, web socket
- end result is an interactive exhibit
- we want a non-deterministic P&J, maybe punch knocks himself out. Surprise is important.


- emotion model is inside agents. Has anyone done this before?
