# Designing Ontologies for Agents.
## Zini, Floriano and Sterling, Leon

Adds explicit ontologies in multi-agent systems based on logic programming.

They use CaseLP, a declarative logical framework for prototyping agent-based applications.

They say that from the point of view of a single agent in a multi-agent system, three different sources of knowledge may be necessary:

- domain knowledge
- agent knowledge
- computational knowledge

They use a multi-agent system to find sports scores on the net.
