# Ontologies for agents
## Huhns, Michael N. and Singh, Munindar P.

An ontology can provide a shared virtual world in which each agent can ground its beliefs and actions. Gives the agents a richer and more useful domain of discourse.

Communication protocols, such as KQML (used by agents to exchange messages) specify syntox, but not semantics of messages.

If two agents are communicating about aircraft and one agents talks about 777s, the other agent might not know what they are talking about. But they can explain by stating that a 777 is a type of aircraft, etc.
