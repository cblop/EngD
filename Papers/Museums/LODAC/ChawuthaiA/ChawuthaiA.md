Proposes a logical model for taxon concepts in RDF
        
Problems with redundant species ids. RDF enables merging.
        
TaxMeOn is a meta-ontology of Biological names[7]
        
Implemented a prototype using Jena for reasoning, Sesame for RDF.
        
Overall, interesting semantic stuff, but not so useful for me.
