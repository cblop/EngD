annote = {Describes the LODAC project, a workflow to generate LOD from web data.

        
LOD consists of key-value pairs in this case. Uses museum collection data in Jp as an example.

        
Following steps are described:
1. Extract key-value pair data from artwork web pages using Apache Nutch and Solr.
2. Map keys in extracted data to a common schema by museum professionals
3. Merge redundantly described artifacts to have one URI.
4. Publish data as LOD with permalinks as a SPARQL endpoint.
5. Store snapshots of each crawled page in a git repository.

        
However, when crawling museum sites there are issues with inconsistently described data.
