@article{Nielsen2006,
annote = {Nielsen observed 90-9-1 principle: 90\% of web users are passive, 9\% sometimes contribute, 1\% do all the work.

        
BUT those 1\% don't seem to have lives. They do nothing but post on forums.

        
With blogs vs internet use as a whole, it's more like 95-5-0.1

        
Of course, Wikipedia is even worse than that.

        
Inequality isn't a problem: the lurkers don't want to contribute! The problem is that the views of these few are not a fair representative of the community as a whole.

        
You can't overcome participation inequality! The best thing to do is just accept it as fact.

        
You can, however:

        
- make it easier to contribute
- make participation a side effect (people who bought these books, bought these other books)
- let users edit instead of create
- reward participants (but not too much)
- promote quality contributors
