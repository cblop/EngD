# Participation inequality: Encouraging more users to contribute
## Nielsen, J

Nielsen observed 90-9-1 principle: 90% of web users are passive, 9% sometimes contribute, 1% do all the work.
        
BUT those 1% don't seem to have lives. They do nothing but post on forums.
        
With blogs vs internet use as a whole, it's more like 95-5-0.1
        
Of course, Wikipedia is even worse than that.
        
Inequality isn't a problem: the lurkers don't want to contribute! The problem is that the views of these few are not a fair representative of the community as a whole.
        
You can't overcome participation inequality! The best thing to do is just accept it as fact.
        
You can, however:
        
- make it easier to contribute
- make participation a side effect (people who bought these books, bought these other books)
- let users edit instead of create
- reward participants (but not too much)
- promote quality contributors
