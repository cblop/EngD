# Storyspace : a Story-driven Approach for Creating Museum Narratives
## Wolff, Annika and Mulholland, Paul and Collins, Trevor

Techniques for creating multiple alternative narrative structures from a single underlying story. Done by selecting different organising principles for the events and plot structures of th estory.
        
Web interface to an ontology for describing curatorial narratives.
        
Uses [curate ontology](http://decipher.open.ac.uk/curate)
        
[1] is another paper on Storyspace. Uses timeline visualisations.
        
[2,3] describe what a structuralist view is. Apparently it's where the events of the story are distinct from the telling of the narrative. [4] explains plot, as does [5]. Basically, all refs from 1-10 describe narratology, and it would be a good idea to read them.
        
"Each heritage object tells a story about why it is significant, what it shows, where it came from, and how it relates to other items in the collection and elsewhere [11]".
        
Hyperties [15] was an early use of hypertext in the museum. Took form of both text and pictures.
        
Ontologies for museum content include Europeana[19], Freebase[20] and the People's Network[21].
        
CHIP project is a recommendation system that merges user preferences with metadata to suggest personalized tours through online cultural content. Agora is similar [22 - 24].
        
Culture Sampo [25, 26] annotates content by events.
        
These all use events to sequence content. However, only chronologically-arranged content is made possible by this kind of data.
        
## Storyspace
Main components of storyspace are:
        
1. story layer, consisting of the events of the story
2. plot layer, describing relationships between the events that move the story forwards
3. narrative layer - ordering events and plots for a narrative presentation
4. heritage objects - info about artifacts with images and links.
        
### Defining story events
Curatorial story contains a set of events, which come from two sources: 
        
1. heritage object stories (when and where an object was created, etc)
2. events that relate to a set or subset of exhibited objects. These provide context.
        
You can have story events, but also facets. Facets can be (for example) time, location or theme and are the important properties of events.
In the system they annotate events with such facet values.
        
### Emplotment
They then 'emplot' the events. This means identifying relationships between events/groups of events to create a kind of narrative.
        
The curator needs to first select the type of plot they want to create (plot type). This determines the nature of the relationship that is being specified (e.g. influenced-by, reacted-against, related-to).
        
Different facets can be used as the primary method of organising a plot. For example, a plot based around artifacts produced would be different from a plot that focuses on the influences that produce them.
        
### Narrative
Narrative is all about the creation and release of tension. So how to make narrative from plot? It's all about the ordering:
        
#### Order by plot description
This organises events by their inclusion in plot descriptions. Each piece is a separate entity. This MINIMISES tension, because all plot pieces are resolved as they are presented.
        
#### Order by plot elements
This **MAXIMISES** tension by leaving the plot descriptions unresolved for as long as possible.
        
In the case of artifacts, this seems to involve saying where a person went and did before describing the artifacts they made.
        
#### Order by plot type
Author says what types of plot they want to show first: eg: related-to, then influenced-by. So the tension is escalated, as arguably there is more drama in the influenced-by relations.
        
### Narrative from plot, then facet
Elements within orevrarching plot ordered according to selected facets.
        
### Narrative from facet, then plot
Organised by themes (e.g. Irish women modernists), with the plot then arranged to fit that theme.
        
Their Storyspace software allows the curator to choose the organising principle (facet/plot/etc). They can drag and drop items to reorder objects and events. 
        
        
        
## Follow-ups
[1] is worth looking at for the underlying ontology.
This paper was a gift. Just about everything in the lit review is relevant.
