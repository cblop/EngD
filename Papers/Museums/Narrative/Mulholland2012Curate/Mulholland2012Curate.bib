annote = {Paper about \_curate\_, an ontology for describing curatorial narratives. Distinguishes narrative from the story and plot.

        
Curatorial narratives express meaning across a number of heritage objects.

        
\#\# The Curate Ontology
**Story**: events to be told.
**Plot** network of relationships on events of the story 
(plot turns a chronology of events into a subjective interpretation of those events)
**Narrative**: a particular telling of that story and plot in some particular media.

        
A narrative presents both a story and a plot.
A story is interpreted by a plot. A number of plots may be created for the same story.

        
If a narrative narrates a story, not a plot, it is simply a chronological retelling of events with no interpretation of them.

        
You can have \_heritage object narratives\_ and \_curatorial narratives\_. The former is just the story of one object, the latter is the thread of the narrative that weaves through multiple objects.

        
Narrative enquiry [19] is a way of researching events to propose a plot and narrative.
In narrative enquiry, the plot is a hypothesis that is tested against the story, which is the data of the experiment.

        
Upper level ontologies used: CIDOC CRM, DOLCE+DnS Ultralite (DUL).

        
\#\# Storyspace
An API to the curate ontology + web interface to the story and heritage object components of the ontology.

        
Made with Drupal.

Bletchley Park Text [1, 2] uses historical interviews, combined with CIDOC CRM [3] event-based metadata. Assembles an online newspaper in response to a query.

        
Hyvonen [4, 5] used event-based metadata to assemble further heritage objects around another that acted as a hub or backbone to the presentation. [5] looks interesting.

        
Wang et al [6, 7] made a recommender system, extended by van Hage [8] to make a real-time routing system that acts as a tour guide.

        
Lim and Aylett [9] also made a personalized tour guide and recommender system.

        
van Erp et al [10] describe a system for event-driven browsing. Suggests heritage objects based on associated events.

        
CIDOC CRM is an upper level ontology for the cultural heritage sector [3]. Can represent how artifacts change over time, as can LODE [11] and SEM [12]. Also look at the Descriptions and Situations ontology [13].

        
Structuralist theories can be used to distinguish story, plot and narrative [18].

        
Narrative enquiry [19] is a way of researching events to propose a plot and narrative.
