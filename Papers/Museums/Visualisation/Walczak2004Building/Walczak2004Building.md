# Building Virtual and Augmented Reality Museum Exhibitions *
## Walczak, Krzysztof and White, Martin and Cellary, Wojciech

How to create AR stuff for museums. They mention early in that model creation is a problem, but cheap 3D scanners will solve this (we are arguably at that point now).
        
Ugh, VRML again.
        
Interesting, they have 3D virtual galleries on the web.
        
They also incorporate an AR-based quiz that uses marker cards that are turned over by the user to respond to questions.
