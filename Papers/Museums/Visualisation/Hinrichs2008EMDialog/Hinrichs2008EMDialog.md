# EMDialog: bringing information visualization into the museum.
## Hinrichs, Uta and Schmidt, Holly and Carpendale, Sheelagh

65" diagonal drafting-board like touchscreen
        
Created a mind-map-like hierarchy of terms related to Emily Carr.
        
Exhibition is a timeline of Emily Carr's life represented as a cross-section of a tree stump.
        
There is also a context-based tree visualisation.
        
Often users were more interested in the interaction and visual effects than the actual content of the exhibition.
        
30% of participants lost interest after less than two minutes.
        
Average interaction time was 2-5 minutes. (also average interaction time for exhibit pieces)
        
Apparently people would spend up to 15 minutes with the piece.
        
Interestingly, previous museum studies have found that visitors mostly approach these kinds of interactive exhibits in groups [22, 27]
        
BUT their system was not designed for group interaction! It doesn't allow multi-user input. They said it wasn't so much of a problem though, as one user usually tends to dominate the interaction.
        
They say that a lot of users likely lost interest due to the large amount of textual information.
        
There was a "performance awareness" aspect where people would feel awkward due to being aware of being watched interacting with the exhibit. [11, 27] document this.
        
People didn't seem to like it. Elderly people complained about a lack of clear instructions.
        
There was 'too much text' and 'not enough pictures'. People like pictures with visualisations.
