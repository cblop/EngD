abstract = {Digital information displays are becoming more common in public spaces such as museums, galleries, and libraries. However, the public nature of these locations requires special considerations concerning the design of information visualization in terms of visual representations and interaction techniques. We discuss the potential for, and challenges of, information visualization in the museum context based on our practical experience with EMDialog, an interactive information presentation that was part of the Emily Carr exhibition at the Glenbow Museum in Calgary. EMDialog visualizes the diverse and multi-faceted discourse about this Canadian artist with the goal to both inform and provoke discussion. It provides a visual environment that allows for exploration of the interplay between two integrated visualizations, one for information access along temporal, and the other along contextual dimensions. We describe the results of an observational study we conducted at the museum that revealed the different ways visitors approached and interacted with EMDialog, as well as how they perceived this form of information presentation in the museum context. Our results include the need to present information in a manner sufficiently attractive to draw attention and the importance of rewarding passive observation as well as both short- and longer term information exploration.},

Created a mind-map-like hierarchy of terms related to Emily Carr.

        
Exhibition is a timeline of Emily Carr's life represented as a cross-section of a tree stump.

        
There is also a context-based tree visualisation.

        
Often users were more interested in the interaction and visual effects than the actual content of the exhibition.

        
30\% of participants lost interest after less than two minutes.

        
Average interaction time was 2-5 minutes. (also average interaction time for exhibit pieces)

        
Apparently people would spend up to 15 minutes with the piece.

        
Interestingly, previous museum studies have found that visitors mostly approach these kinds of interactive exhibits in groups [22, 27]

        
BUT their system was not designed for group interaction! It doesn't allow multi-user input. They said it wasn't so much of a problem though, as one user usually tends to dominate the interaction.

        
They say that a lot of users likely lost interest due to the large amount of textual information.

        
There was a "performance awareness" aspect where people would feel awkward due to being aware of being watched interacting with the exhibit. [11, 27] document this.

        
People didn't seem to like it. Elderly people complained about a lack of clear instructions.

        
There was 'too much text' and 'not enough pictures'. People like pictures with visualisations.
