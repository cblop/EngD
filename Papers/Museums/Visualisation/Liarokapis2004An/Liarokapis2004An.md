2004, so a bit outdated.
        
Looks at using Web3D (?) and AR to allow accessibility for disabled users.
        
Sadly, a lot of this is outdated because it predates the rise of touchscreen devices.
        
This is awful! Assumes knowledge of XML by end user: "The user is presented with a very user friendly GUI for editing the XML configuration data" WTF?!
        
VRML? This is hopelessly outdated and irrelevant. Even in 2004!
