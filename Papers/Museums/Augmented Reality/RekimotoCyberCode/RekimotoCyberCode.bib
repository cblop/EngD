This paper is OLD: 2000

        
Can do real-life drag and drop: put a id-tagged piece of paper on an id-tagged printer.

        
Each tag is just an ID, so not much data needs to be encoded (like a URI). Any information needed is looked up in a database.

        
Also estimates the 3D position and orientation of a tag relative to the camera. This means that the tag itself can be an input method. One example is moving the tag like a cursor, or marking on a card that has the tag in a dialog box-like way.

        
Another use could be for indoor guidance systems.},
