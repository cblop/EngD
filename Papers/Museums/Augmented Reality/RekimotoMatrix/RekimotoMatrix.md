# Matrix : A Realtime Object Identi cation and Registration Method for Augmented Reality
## Rekimoto, Jun

Identifies and estimates the position of real-world objects.
        
Uses a 2D matrix marker (looks like QR code).
        
Detection algorithm works by binarising the image, then analysing its components to estimate the location of the marker.
        
Information authoring tool determines the position of a 3D point in the real world based on the stereo vision method.
        
Interesting way of annotating the real-life thing: fig 6.a shows 3d annotations.
        
## Other approaches

Template matching [7]
Landmark tracking and magnetic tracking [5]
