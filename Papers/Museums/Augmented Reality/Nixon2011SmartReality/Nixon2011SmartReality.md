# SmartReality : Augmented Reality + Services + Semantics
## Nixon, Lyndon and Grubert, Jens and Reitmayr, Gerhard

Steps:
        
1. Current view from video frames + GPS -> object recognition
2. "What?": services framework -> content served according to context. Based on recognized objects, annotations of the services. Refined by info on user's interests, context and environment.
3. "How?": semantic data infrastructure, formally modelled ontologies
        
Relies on web services to supply data.
        
AR approaches typically focus on "points of interest", where all info is obtained in the POI data set.
        
For SmartReality, they give each thing a URI, then the data is retrieved from a web service when needed.
