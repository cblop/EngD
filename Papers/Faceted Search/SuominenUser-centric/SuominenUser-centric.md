# User-centric Faceted Search for Semantic Portals
## Suominen, Osma and Viljanen, Kim and Hyv, Eero

[1-3] are the original Faceted Search papers
        
[3-5] are _semantic faceted search_ (facets are based on ontological structures)
        
[5,6] are applications of faceted search
        
(beware: a lot of the above are the authors self-citing)
        
This paper theorises that domain-specific ontologies are often different from how a user would want to categorise and browse data.
        
[7-9] is their user-centric card sorting method for creating intuitive search facets, which map on to a health-related ontology (really?)
        
They used a bunch of existing ontologies, rather than making their own. They made a good argument for this.
        
## Card sorting
I did this for Fabio's research. You just get a bunch of cards with titles and sort them into intuitively arranged piles. You can be given the categories beforehand, or you can use 'open' card sorting, where the participants create their own categories.
        
Once they got a user's categories from the card sorting, they mapped them to the actual ontologies.
