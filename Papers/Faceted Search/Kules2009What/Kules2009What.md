# What do exploratory searchers look at in a faceted search interface?
## Kules, Bill and Capra, Robert and Banta, Matthew and Sierra, Tito

Used eye tracking to see where users look at when using faceted search interfaces.
        
Results show participants spending 50 seconds per task looking at results, 25 seconds looking at facets, 6 seconds on the query itself.
        
Look at the Flamenco system [11, 31], which provides interfaces to specialised collections, such as art.
        
Faceted search counts as exploratory search. There is a good overview of exploratory search here.
        
Interesting, but not necessary for my paper.
