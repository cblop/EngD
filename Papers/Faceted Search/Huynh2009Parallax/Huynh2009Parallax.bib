annote = {Proposes a new way of browsing the web: rather than going from one thing to another related thing, why not go from one set of things to a related set of things?

        
Parallax is their set-based browsing system. It is designed for use with FreeBase.

        
For example, one can find all presidents, then all their children, then the institutions they were educated at. Then you can generate a map of all the school's locations!

        
Along with the results, a list of \_connections\_ is shown. This is a group of hyperlinks from current result set to other database entries. Kind of like recommendations?

        
Has support for aggregate visualisations. Very clever, actually.

        
\#\# Transitions
Can make lots of different transitions, like one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.

        
One to many: a company to its employees
Many-to-many: from browsing several artists to their artworks
Many-to-one: several movies -> one actor that won best picture award (filter)
