## Koren, Jonathan and Zhang, Yi and Liu, Xue

Paper proposed the use of collaborative filtering and personalisation to customise th esearch interface to each user's behaviour.
        
Also proposes a utility based framework to evaluate the faceted interface.
        
Makes the point that faceted search is kind of like advanced search queries like author:professor x, etc
        
So, their aim is to make a _personalised_ faceted search system.
        
Has a model of a user, and calculates how relevant each facet is to them.
