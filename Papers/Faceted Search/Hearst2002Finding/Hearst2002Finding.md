Introduces FLAMENCO.
        
Three types of questions:
1. How tall is the average female giraffe?
2. What are some good design ideas for landscaping my client's yard?
3. What are some promising untried treatments for Raynaud's disease?
        
Google and question-answering search are great for 1.
        
2. is more open-ended. Would be nice to browse through related images, and allow a shift from images related to one idea to another idea. Should not interupt the chain of though.
        
3. is harder, and would usually be solved using text mining or knowledge discovery. Requires a lot of abilities: comparison, reasoning, etc.
        
This paper focuses on questions like 2. 
        
So, their interface needs to support both direct search and browsing.
        
Obviously, users prefer direct text search if they know what they want, but a browsing (faceted) interface if they don't.
        
Their interface is typical faceted with categories and breadcrumbs, but also an ever-present search box.

Dataset used: architectural image database with 40, 000 photos of landscapes and buildings from a wide variety of historical periods, styles and locations.
        
They did a usability study , which seems to favour their interface.
        
They didn't use or consider semantic stuff, though.
