# Usability Studies of Faceted Browsing: A Literature Review
## Fagan, Jody Condit

Looks at faceted browsing from a usability perspective.
        
Seems like other people combine the clustering tools with faceted stuff.
        
Some studies revealed that users found more answers using faceted search. Also, satisfaction scores for the questionnaire were much higher than for the ranking or cluster tools.
        
Another study found that people could also find results much faster with faceted search.
        
Yet another study says how faceted search is more suitable for:
- simple look-up tasks
- data exploration and analysis tasks
- free exploration tasks
        
Worth having a look at Aquabrowser. This appears to be a faceted search browser for libraries.
        
Latter part of the paper is about study design.
