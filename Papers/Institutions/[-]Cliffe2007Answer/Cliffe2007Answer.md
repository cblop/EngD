ASP permits the statement of problems and queries in domain-specific terms as executable logic programs. Eliminates the gap between specification and verification language.

## What is an institution?
What agents do or say is governed by an institutional context.

Institutional events are generated by society: "murder" as opposed to "shoot someone", which is the physical action.

An institution is a set of _institutional states_ that evolve over time subject to the occurrence of events.

An _institutional state_ is a set of _institutional fluents_ that may be held to be true at some instant. These fluents can further be separated into _domain fluents_ (which depend on the institution being modelled, and _normative fluents_, which are common to all specifications.

Normative fluents are classified as:

- institutional power: does the institution have the capability to bring about an event? The authority?
- permission: captures that some event may occur without violation
- obligation: states that a particular event is obliged to occur before a given deadline event

Events may be classified into:

- set of observable events, outside of the institution
- set of institutional events (violation events and institutional actions)
