# From Aristotle to Gabriel: A Summary of the Narratology Literature for Story Technologies
## Kwiat, Joanna

This is very useful as a reference. It provides a _very_ comprehensive summary and basic introduction to narratology.

## 1: Past and contemporary story models
Two landmark theories: Aristotle (350BC) and Gabriel (2000).

Born out of French Structuralism and Russian Formalism, narratology proposes that narrative and narration are separable.
The idea is that narrative has structural regularities, and so can be modelled.

Narrative is the discourse: the delivered text in a given medium. Bal says that it's a layered model with plot providing the forward dynamic, story providing the setting, characters and a logical arrangement of events, and narrative providing the stance of the teller where the teller is distinct from the author.

Plot: cause and effect event pairs that are only (maybe) implicit in the story are made explicit.

Then there is discussion of genre types and their elements (e.g. comedy, tragedy, epic).

### Grammatical models
Propp (1928) made a formal model for Russian folk tales. Very useful formalisation, provides a framework for things to come (pg 30). Any number of combinations of elements can be combined for various different narratives.

Dundes (1963, 1964) extended this model for North American folktales, modifying it.

Bartlett (1932) looked at how people recall stories. He found that there was a 'rule of structure' that operated not just at the recall stage, but also as a story is being perceived.

Freytag (1863) theorised a pyramid based on Aristotle's tragedy. From the _Introduction_, it _rises_ to the _Climax_, then _falls_ to _Catastrophe_.

Bremond (1966) integrates perspective into his theory. Takes a starting point and uses _functions_ as basic narrative units. "Elementary sequences" are triads of functions, where a function opens a process with an action or event potntial, then there is the realisation of the action or event, and then a function closes the process with a result of the cation or event. This differns from Propp in that the narrator chooses whether and how these functions execute.

Elementary sequence described can be an amelioration (movement towards equilibrium) or a degradation (movement towards disequilibrium).

Elem. seqs. can be combined into three different configs: _end-to-end series_ (links two or more elementary sequences), _enclave_ (two or more simultaneous ESs describe the same process but at different levels of specificity) and _coupling_ (possible, alternative perspectives).

Labov and Waletzky (1966) also tried to identify the basic functional units of narrative and determine its overall structure. They examined oral personal experience narratives.

They found two functions of narrative: to refer to events experienced and to evaluate the experience. Narratives containing only the former are "empty".

They looked at temporal theories of narrative. A narrative clause must occupy a given position in a temporal sequence of clauses, that if moved to another position would alter the original meaning of the narrative. Free clauses can be positioned anywhere without affecting the original interpretation. Restricted clauses can be repositioned with less freedom. Clauses with identical repositioning scope are coordinate clauses (so all free clauses are these).

The primary sequence is a string of time junctures joined with a _then_. It is found by:
- merging any coordinate clauses
- abstracting and bringing to the leftmost position any contained free clauses
- then any contained restricted clauses

They found that narrative structure generally consists of five parts: orientation (setting), complication (establishment of multiple narratives), evaluation (narrator's perspective of narrated events), resolution (comes after/with evaluation) and coda (marks end of narrative time and return to present moment in time. Follows resolution).

#### Structure of myth
Levi Strauss (1973) did a structural study of myth, like what Propp did for Russian folk tales. Divides a story onto smallest possible units (mythemes). Then arrange mythemes into columns and rows (mythemes in a given column have a common feature) in the order they appear.

#### Actantial model
Greimas (1966) proposed the actantial model of narrative structure, drawing on > 4 theories:

1. Levi-strauss' theory of opposition (concept A can't be understood without not A)
2. Syntactical functioning of discourse
3. Propp and Souriau's inventories of actants (dramatis personae and dramaturgic dunctions)

## 2: Recent theories and implementations

Rumelhart (1975) and Thorndyke (1975) used grammars. Thorndyke's implementation is more complete.

Pavel's grammar (1985) also looks interesting.

Kurtz and Snowden 2002 created NPML (Narrative Pattern Markup Language)
