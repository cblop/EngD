annote = {They reference "Hamlet in the Holodeck" and say that the idea of the Holodeck is the "Holy grail of new media".

        
At the other end of the scale is Hypertext Fiction, where the user clicks on one of a number of presented choices to choose a path through the game.

        
Trouble is, a user's choices have to be severely restricted to respect narrative logic.

        
Narrativity: meaning
Interactivity: play

        
Combo of narrativity and interactivity oscillates between:
- narrative game, where narrative meaning is subordinated to the player's actions
- playable story: player's actions are subordinated to narrative meaning

        
(In a narrative game, story is meant to enhance gameplay, but in a playable story, gameplay is meant to produce a story)

        
Two kinds of games: free-play, imaginative games (paidia) and strictly controlled rule-based games (ludus).

        
Then, within ludus, you have abstract (football, chess, etc) and narrativized. In the abstract, the rules of the game make playing desirable, but for the latter, the narrative is what drives the player forward. The kinds of goals we make in daily life are automatically created by the player.

        
States that the only working example of interactive drama is Facade!

        
\#\# Holodeck
They look at how you'd want a holodeck to be implemented. They say that a narrative would have to be interacted with via bodily movements as well as vocalisation.

        
Trouble with natural language input is that there's no guarantee that the system will understand the input and respond in a logical way.

        
Facade allows you to type in what you want, but responds inappropriately quite often.

        
IF parsers, on the other hand, restrict what you can do by having a rigid syntax. Parsers just reject what they don't understand.

        
Most games, though, require you to select a dialogue option from a menu of choices, which is very limiting. Problem is that this stops the flow of the game and displays a jarring menu.

        
They describe games like Myst, that force you to solve puzzles to progress in a story, as "constipated stories"!

        
\#\# Types of game design
- bottom-up: like the Sims, you have so many possible interactions that the emerging narrative is impossible to predict

        
Top-down approach games are typical for narrative games. There is always an end destination in the narrative, although there might be branching options. Can start with a gameplay idea and make it into a story, or make a story world and insert ways to interact into it.

        
Ryan believes that any future interactive narrative solution should be a novel combination of top-down and bottom-up design.

        
\#\# Immersion
Ryan differentiates between ludic immersion and narrative immersion. Narrative immersion requires the use of the imagination to construct a world.

        
Ryan thinks that the greatest hurdle is to combine the self-centred emotions we feel from life and games with the other-centred emotions of traditional narratives (empathy for characters), the creation of personal and evolving relations between your agent and the game's characters.},
