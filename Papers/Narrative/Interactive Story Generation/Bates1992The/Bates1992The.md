# The nature of characters in interactive worlds and the Oz project
## Bates, Joseph

Very old paper: 1992. Describes the Oz project.

Three areas of research:

- construction of broadly capable autonomous agents that integrate elments of perception, cognition, emotion, action and language.
- the construction of a computational theory of interactive drama
- the development of computational methods for varying the presentation style

"Eliza effect": people see subtletly, understanding and emotion in an agent, even if it is not intended (and as long as it does not actively destroy the illusion).

They try to create an agent cat called "Lyotard" in this paper.
