# Your Turn: Interactive Story Continuing Agent
## Yu-Te Shen, Edward

## Summary
This is just an intro to interactive storytelling systems. Not much else. Useful for the descriptions of TALE-SPIN and MINSTREL, though, since those paper's aren't online.

Good intro to structure-based storytelling systems in sec 4.

## Content

Two main features: story understanding and story generation.

System uses plan recognition, which can usually be divided into two types: _keyhole recognition_ (where the acting agent or user is unaware of the happening of the recognition) and _intended recognition_ (the acting agent or person makes efforts to clarify their plan to the recognising agent).

Uses Charniak's work which applies Bayesian systems to plan recognition

They also present a reading comprehension system (that can read something and answer basic "WH" questions)

Nice description of MINSTREL. Seems to be a system based on planning and executing goals.
