# Narratives as programs
## Reiter, Raymond

Says that narratives are non-deterministic programs.

They investigate how suitable a situation calculus-based programming language (GOLOG) is for describing narratives.

I guess the examples describe what program an agent would have in order to achieve a certain narrative. An odditity is the _dark and stormy_? conditional for "It was a dark and stormy night".
