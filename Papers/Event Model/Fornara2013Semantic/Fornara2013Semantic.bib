Introduces Artificial Institutions (AIs) for the integration of open interaction systems into museum spaces

        
\#\# Open interaction systems
\_Dynamic distributed event-based systems\_ having these components:

        
- A state that evolves due to events that happen and actions performed by agents.
- No assumptions can be made on interactin agents' behaviour, so \_norms\_ are a fundamental part of open systems. Norms are used to express restrictions on agent behaviour.

        
Not sure how useful this paper is. Might have to look at it if I want to use agents.},
