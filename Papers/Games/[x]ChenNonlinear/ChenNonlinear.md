# Nonlinear Storytelling in Games: Deconstructing the Varieties of Nonlinear Experiences
## Chen, Sherol

References Marie-Laure Ryan book, Avatars of Story. Might be worth picking that and some others up.

This article explores the relationship between story and discourse.

## Level 1 - Story-level nonlinear
Stories almost never start at the very beginning (of time). There'll always be some prior history, for example in the form of characters' backstories.

Characters often begin the game with Amnesia. The character, like the player, starts with no prior knowledge of events.

The amount of story-level non-linearity is apparent in the large amount of undisclosed back story.

## Level 2 - Discourse-level nonlinear
This is the more typical use of nonlinear narrative.
Could be breaking chronology or perspective.

### Temporal
Narratives told with broken chronology

### Perspective
Perspectives of different characters are followed, like in Rashomon.

So, on the discourse level, Facade is linear both temporally and in terms of perspective

## Level 3 - Interaction-level nonlinear
This means that a game can have more than one possible plotline and ending, so the player can take the path of their choosing. This increases replay value.

## Application
Terminal Time is an architecture for this sort of thing: definitely worth a look.

OZ Project is worth a look, too.

## Future thoughts
- objective layer: formalised representation of events, event artifacts and existents.
- perspective layer: formalised representation of operations, motivations and reactions of intelligent existents
- investigative layer: formalised representation of observable info from artifacts and existents.
- presentation layer: formalised representation of discourse.
- interactive layer: formalised representation of manipulation of discourse
