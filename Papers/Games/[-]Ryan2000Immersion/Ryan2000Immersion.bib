Hypertext is like a network of linked passages of text. So the reader may choose the order they visit the node, but the network will always stay the same.
Could the hypertextual system generate text in real time, in response to the reader's decisions? This is what happens in simulative systems (i.e. controlling a plane).

This limit on the user's freedom is probably necessary for interactive narratives. (Howard Rheingold)
