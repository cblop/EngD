# Digital game ontology: Semantic web approach on enhancing game studies
## Chan, J.T.C. and Yuen, W.Y.F.

Looks at Music Ontology Project [1] to make a game ontology based on the Game Ontology Project [3].
        
They have separate ontologies for the play process and the production process of games.
        
SWRL: Semantic Web Rule Language. Used to express rules as well as logic. Combines with OWL DL.
        
This project also creates an actual ontology of video game titles, kind of like a DBPedia for video games
