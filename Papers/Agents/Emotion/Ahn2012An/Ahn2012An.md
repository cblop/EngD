Looks at modelling non-verbal communication and facial expressions.

Three dimensional emotion axes: 

- Valence (intrinsic attactiveness/aversiveness of an event/object/situation): positive/negative valence
- Arousal: being awake or reactive to stimuli
- Dominance.

So, it's the VAD coordinate system.

Also need to take into account:

- Short Term Emotions
- Long Term Emotions
- Inter-Personal Emotions

Look at page 4 for the facial expressions decided upon, and how they relate to the VAD model.
