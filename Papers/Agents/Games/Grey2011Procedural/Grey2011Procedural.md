# Procedural quests: A focus for agent interaction in role-playing-games
## Grey, John and Bryson, Joanna J

NPC design here is capable of dynamic dialog. Context is generated from both episodic memory and emotional memories of previous social interactions.

The problem it stops is this: if a player does something to harm their reputation (like kill a civilian), the information doesn't travel immediately, but instead propagates through social agents.

Reactive AI is probably too simple to carry a narrative plot.

So instead, there tends to be a more formal planning system on top of the reactive system, like in Facade.
(Drama manager + agents)

Bryson thinks that authors should have better ways of creating the characters that will drive the narrative for themselves [13].

Yoda stories! Procedural quests!

Mateas: the prom. This and Facade show social behaviours as part of game mechanics.

## Believable Social Agents

1. A set of general-purpose priorities for the agent
2. Individual memory and perception
3. Conversational ability

Uses Behaviour Oriented Design (BOD), rather than decision trees/hierarchical plans, etc.

Also uses POSH (similar to behaviour trees)

NPCs hav episodic memory, emotions and perception, used for context.

SOAR: general purpose cognitive architecture

Integer values hold strength of opinion, such as fear and hate. So emotions are directed at particular individuals, rather than a global state.
