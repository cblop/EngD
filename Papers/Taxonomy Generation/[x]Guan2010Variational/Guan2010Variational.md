## Guan, Yue and Dy, Jennifer G and Niu, Donglin and Ghahramani, Zoubin

They use a Bayesian model to discover several clustering solutions and the feature subset views that generated each clester partitioning.

Feature selection for clustering: [9]

Features are clustered separately.

VERY VERY technical. They use it to classify images of faces.
