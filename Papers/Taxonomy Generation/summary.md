# Taxonomy Generation - Summary
## Weinberger2005Taxonomies.md
C - High-level, fluffy. But interesting.

## SchwarzkopfMining.md
C - They used Heymann et al's algorithm, which seems to get good results. They also looked at Schitz et al's algorithm, which seems to produce even better results.

## Vinh2010Information.md
C - Difficult for me to understand. Seems to be implementing information theory in another field. Perhaps too complex for what I want to do.


## Stoica2007Automating.md
A - use their reference for manually created hierarchies. Seems like a ripoff of Dakka 2005. Uses Subsumption (Sanderson) and WordNet.

## Dakka2006Automatic.md
A+ - Expands on their 2005 paper, integrates external sources such as WordNet, Google and Wikipedia to identify facets, rather than just clusterings.

## Cutting1992Scattergather.md
C - Very old paper, historical interest only. Could be an inspiration for faceted browsing.

## Dakka2005Automatic.md
A+ - Very good method for clustering then ranking categories into facets. Highly worth implementing with lots of great algorithms and ideas

## Glaser2011How.md
B - guidelines for manually creating a set of facets. Maybe good for citing.

## HenschelComparison.md
B - Adaptation of Heymann

## Heymann2006Collaborative.md
B - OK algorithm for hierarchical taxonomy generation. Dakka is better, though.

## Kwasnik2000The.md
C - Not so relevant, just a look at different classification methods.

## Schmitz2006Inducing.md
B - Worth another look. Uses Sanderson & Croft subsumption like Dakka2005
