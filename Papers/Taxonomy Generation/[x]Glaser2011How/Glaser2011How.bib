annote = {Faceted classification: a set of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive categories, each made by isolating one perspective on the items (a facet) that combine to completely describe all the objects in question, and which users can use, by searching and browsing, to find what they need.

        
Four classificatory structures (Kwasnick 99): hierachies, trees, paradigms and facets.

        
Best-known faceted universal classification systems: colon classification and BC2 (bliss bibliographic classification v.2) Ranganathan 62.

        
Colon:

        
- personality (the thing in question)
- matter (what it's made of)
- energy (how something changes, is processed, evolves)
- space (where something is)
- time (when it happens)

        
BC2 can provide more, though (BRoughton 2001, 79)

        
- thing/entity
- kind
- part
- property
- material
- process
- operation
- patient
- product
- by-product
- agent
- space
- time

        
For art the [art and architecture thesaurus](http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting\_research/vocabularies/aat/) (Petersen 1994, 26) can be used:

        
- associated concepts (e.g. philosophy)
- physical attributes (density)
- styles and periods (simulationist (like space and time))
- agents (people/organisations) (lighthouse keepers)
- activities (thinking) (similar te Energy)
- materials (plywood) (similar to Matter)
- objects (bunk beds) (similar to Personality)

        
\#\#\# Spiteri's simplifiedf model for facet analysis
Louise Spiteri (1998) analyzed Ranganathan tecs's rules and made a simpler set.

        
See article for the full list.

        
\#\#\# Facet creation
Steps proposed are:

        
1. domain collection
2. entity listing
3. facet creation - use colon and BC2 as starting points, as well as drawing from other classifications for inspiration
4. facet arrangement - different facets can have different ways of being displayed. E.g. in AAT, period facet can be displayed as a timeline, materials facet can be a hierarchy, place facet can be a part/whole tree, etc. Use whatever is best.
5. citation order
6. classification
7. revision, testing and maintenance

        
(I think it makes sense to use AAT as a basis, and see if I can consult someone here that has domain specific knowledge of Japanese art)},
