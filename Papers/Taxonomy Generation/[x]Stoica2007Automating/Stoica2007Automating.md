# Automating Creation of Hierarchical Faceted Metadata Structures
## Stoica, Emilia and Hearst, Marti A and Berkeley, U C and Richardson, Megan

Their algorithm is Castanet. Generates hierarchical faceted metadata from textual descriptions of items. Uses sources like WordNet to create a hierarchical faceted structure.

As well as Yee 2003, they cite Weinberger 2005 as an influence on hierarchical faceted metadata.

Rosen and Morville 2002 is a good example of how metadata category structures are generally manually created.

They say that HFC is "in between a monolithic hierarchy and a full-blown ontology. Does not capture relations and inferences."

But working out a facet hierarchy is easier than an ontology.

Cites Sanderson and Croft's subsumption method as a basis for hierarchy building algorithms.

Lots of people use WordNet. They also cite Navigli and Velardi. WordNet's source is fellbaum 1998, worth including.

Uses hypernyms from WordNet, just like Dakka2005.

Why do they totally ignore Dakka? Their technique is so similar.

Their system uses WordNet _domains_, which are a cross-categorization mechanism.
So, a domain is like a facet.

So, just cite this as using subsumption and WordNet.
