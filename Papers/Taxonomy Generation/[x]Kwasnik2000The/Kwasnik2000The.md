# The Role of Classification in Knowledge Represantation and Discovery
## Kwasnik, Barbara H

Big overview of different methods of classification. Useful to understand where faceted classification fits in, but otherwise not so interesting.
        
Could use these for facets:
        
- period/style
- place
- process
- material
- object
        
Period: timeline
Materials: hierarchy
Place: part/whole tree
