# Information Theoretic Measures for Clusterings Comparison : Variants, Properties, Normalization and Correction for Chance
## Vinh, Nguyen Xuan

They:
        
- review and categorise information theoretic similarity and distance measures for clustering comparison. Then discuss two important properties: normalisation and metric properties. Do the _normalised information distance_ (NID) and the _normalised variation of information_ (NVI) satisfy both these properties?
- explain why adjusting information theoretic measures for chance is important
- they advocate the normalised information distance (NID) as a general purpose measure for comparing clusterings (it's both a metric and a normalise measure)
