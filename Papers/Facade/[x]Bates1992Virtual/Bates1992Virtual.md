# Virtual Reality, Art and Entertainment.
## Bates, Joseph

Lots of stuff about the very early days of VR. From the same group as the Oz project.

The idea is that a virtual world has to respond to its users without the creators' help. This should probably be achieved with agents.

Mentions the Oz project at Carnegie Mellon.

"Eliza effect": Eliza was a simple NLP agent that used keywords. But people saw subtlety, understanding and emotion in an agent that isn't there.

## Drama
"Some worlds are best modeled as free running simulations... However, at least some of the time, the creator will want to impose longer term structure on the evolution of the world."

Director: a computational theory of interactive drama. 'Directs' the course of the game

Relationship between the director and the user is like a game of chess. The director pushes the course of events according to what the creator wants, so can 'win' if these events pan out. But the user has some say in what happens.
