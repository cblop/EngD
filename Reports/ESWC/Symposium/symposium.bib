annote = {They reference "Hamlet in the Holodeck" and say that the idea of the Holodeck is the "Holy grail of new media".

        
At the other end of the scale is Hypertext Fiction, where the user clicks on one of a number of presented choices to choose a path through the game.

        
Trouble is, a user's choices have to be severely restricted to respect narrative logic.

        
Narrativity: meaning
Interactivity: play

        
Combo of narrativity and interactivity oscillates between:
- narrative game, where narrative meaning is subordinated to the player's actions
- playable story: player's actions are subordinated to narrative meaning

        
(In a narrative game, story is meant to enhance gameplay, but in a playable story, gameplay is meant to produce a story)

        
Two kinds of games: free-play, imaginative games (paidia) and strictly controlled rule-based games (ludus).

        
Then, within ludus, you have abstract (football, chess, etc) and narrativized. In the abstract, the rules of the game make playing desirable, but for the latter, the narrative is what drives the player forward. The kinds of goals we make in daily life are automatically created by the player.

        
States that the only working example of interactive drama is Facade!

        
\#\# Holodeck
They look at how you'd want a holodeck to be implemented. They say that a narrative would have to be interacted with via bodily movements as well as vocalisation.

        
Trouble with natural language input is that there's no guarantee that the system will understand the input and respond in a logical way.

        
Facade allows you to type in what you want, but responds inappropriately quite often.

        
IF parsers, on the other hand, restrict what you can do by having a rigid syntax. Parsers just reject what they don't understand.

        
Most games, though, require you to select a dialogue option from a menu of choices, which is very limiting. Problem is that this stops the flow of the game and displays a jarring menu.

        
They describe games like Myst, that force you to solve puzzles to progress in a story, as "constipated stories"!

        
\#\# Types of game design
- bottom-up: like the Sims, you have so many possible interactions that the emerging narrative is impossible to predict

        
Top-down approach games are typical for narrative games. There is always an end destination in the narrative, although there might be branching options. Can start with a gameplay idea and make it into a story, or make a story world and insert ways to interact into it.

        
Ryan believes that any future interactive narrative solution should be a novel combination of top-down and bottom-up design.

        
\#\# Immersion
Ryan differentiates between ludic immersion and narrative immersion. Narrative immersion requires the use of the imagination to construct a world.

        
Ryan thinks that the greatest hurdle is to combine the self-centred emotions we feel from life and games with the other-centred emotions of traditional narratives (empathy for characters), the creation of personal and evolving relations between your agent and the game's characters.},

\#\# Challenges of studying games
- Issues describing games (the vocab isn't there)

        
\#\# Game Ontology Project
Their ontology identifies the important structural elements of games and the relationships between them, organising them hierarchically.

        
Available at www.gameontology.org

        
People can add to the ontology through a wiki-style website

        
They had students add their favourite games to the ontology

        
Expert evaluation said that 60\% should be kept, 14.5\% should be removed, 25.5\% were ambivalent.

Can act as a grounding for more domain-specific knowledge representation.

        
[6] is Music Ontology paper
[7] is Timeline Ontology
[8] is OWL-Time
[12] is Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records ontology

        
Interval and Instant are from OWL-Time. Timeline Ontology adds TimeLine: a backbone for temporal information.

        
Using the Event Ontology, music production can be modelled as events.

        
They based their event representation on the \_token-reification [10] approach: each event occurrence is a first class object or 'token'.

        
Events can be sounds, performances, compositions, transduction/recording.

        
EVENT ONTOLOGY LOOKS USEFUL

        
\#\# Events
Events have
- factors (instrument)
- products (sound produced)
- agents (performer)

        
Can be linked to a place through event:place

        
FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records ontology) has these concepts:
- work (abstract, distinct, artistic creation)
- manifestation (physical embodiment, like a record)
- item (single exemplar of such a manifestation, like a particular CD)

        
They also use FOAF.

        
They define MusicalWork on top of FRBR, MusicalManifestation (record/track, etc), MusicalItem (stream, particular CD/vinyl).

        
On top of FOAF, they have MusicArtist and MusicGroup

        
On top of the Event Ontology, they have Composition (creation of a MusicalWork), Arrangement (arrangement of a MusicalWork)

        
It can have a MusicalWork as a factor, an Arranger as an agent and a Score as a product, for example.

        
A Performance denotes a particular Performance, it can have factors like a MusicalWork and a Score. Agents could be a number of musical instruments, equipments and agents could be a number of musicians, sound engineers, conductors, listeners, etc.

        
Have a look at MusicBrainz for their instrument taxonomy.
