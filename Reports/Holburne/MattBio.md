Matthew Thompson has extensive experience with developing visualisations and interactive systems for both mobile devices and the web. His focus is on creating intuitive, easy to use applications that help people to understand data. He has worked with an institute in Tokyo to develop interactive visualisations to help people to explore the data in Japanese museums. Combining a background in HCI research and his experience developing for iOS, Android and the web, he is able to create both elegant back-end systems and front-end user experiences that are delightful to use.
