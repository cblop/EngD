Briefing Virtual
Actors: a First
Report on the
PRESTO Project
(Paolo Busetta,
Chiara Ghidini,
Antonella De Angeli
& Zeno Menestrina)

- Look at the DICE framework - uses BDI agents, but also allows ontological tagging of attitutes, etc
- DOLCE is upper level ontology

> Everything they do is independent of game engine, can be applied to 2D rendering or VR stuff

### Game Engine
E-semble's XVR: emergency management and training. Based on Unity.


## Toward Using Games and AI to Proactively Sense the Real World
Mark Riedl

Upcoming paper: Yu and Riedl, Interactive Narrative

# Automating fictional ideation using conceptnet

## Fictional ideation
Coming up with ideas for fiction: "What if...?"
WHIM project: fictional ideation -> what-if machine
Take a concept from conceptnet, create a fictional idea by altering a CN relation

### Evaluation
Ideas are evaluated using inference chaining. Volume and av. length of chains are the measure of narrative potential. Total length of chain is the ranking score.

# Reviewing Propp's Story Generation Procedure in the Light of Computational Creativety
Pablo Gervas

Trouble with Propp's formalism is that you can have unresolved items: tasks that aren't resolved, villains that go unpunished, etc.

Can be solved by implementing dependencies

Uses dependencies as metrics to evaluate the output

So this is pretty rigid, not creative. But now there are rules to break(?) to make it creative
