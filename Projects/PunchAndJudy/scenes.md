# How to implement multiple scenes

Pretty tricky.

The obvious way to end a scene is when a character dies. But there are two cases where a character doesn't die:

- Joey introduces the show
- Joey annoys punch

In the second case, the scene can end when Punch is annoyed to the point of leaving the stage.

In the first case, Joey has to summon Punch. So the next scene can start once Joey has left (Punch remains on the stage).
