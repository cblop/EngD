# Punch and Judy dialogue
(need some kind of ask/respond mechanism)
(how can we have people talk in a certain way to certain characters?)

## Punch
### Happy, OK
"Hello, X"
"What a lovely day it is today!"
"Give us a kiss!" (Judy only?)
"Oh I do like to be beside the seaside!"
"That's the way to do it!"
"(humming)"

### Annoyed
"Don't you talk to me like that!"
"You be quiet, or you're going to regret it!"
"Your stupid face is making me angry!"
"Shut up!"
"Stop annoying me, you silly sausage!"

### Angry
"Hitty hitty hitty!"
"Stay still when I'm hitting you!"
"Die!"
"(laughing)"
"Take that!"

## Judy
### Happy
"Hello hello hello!"
"Good to see you, my dear!"
"What a lovely day it is today!"
"I feel like dancing!"

### Worried
"Have you seen the baby?"
"Where's our baby?"
"Have you done the dishes yet?"
"Look at the state of our house! It's a mess!"
"How are we ever going to pay all our bills?"

### Distressed
"Help!"
"Someone help me!"
"Police!"
"Stop!"
"Noooo!"

### Normal
"How are we all today?"
"Hello, boys and girls!"
"Oh look, it's (X)"
