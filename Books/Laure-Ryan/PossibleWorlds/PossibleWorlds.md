# Possible worlds, artificial intelligence, and narrative theory
## Ryan, Marie-Laure

Narrative, literature and fiction are distinct. Non-and otherwise forms of each three can be combined, and there are examples of all combinations.

First part of book: definition of fictionality. Second part: semantics of narrativity.

Semantic domain of a narrative contains subworlds, created by the mental activity of characters.

Page 4 lists some papers that combine modal logic with semantics, but they're in French!
